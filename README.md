# Amulet Raider

2022 Seven-day Roguelike Challenge (7DRL) Entry - TypeScript edition

This is a mashup of Rogue and XQuest (which is based on Crystal Quest).

My first TypeScript program. The original Javascript version has source
at [Github](https://github.com/mcneja/7drl-2022) and is playable at
[Github.io](https://mcneja.github.io/7drl-2022/index.html).

Run a web server out of the web subdirectory to play it.
